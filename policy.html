We automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with our sites and apps, for example your internet protocol (IP) address, mobile device ID, time zone setting, location data, language preference, operating system, platform. We may use this information to collect data about your activities on our sites and apps and on third-party sites, apps and platforms, such as Facebook. We may associate information that indirectly identifies you with your user account (if you have one) and other information we have collected about you.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>– Location data. We may collect geo-data, which tells us where you are, when we collect other information about you. We may also collect the language option or country you choose. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Comments</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>We do not disclose email addresses to other users.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Media</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included.

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Analytics</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>We use common tracking technologies to evaluate device and access data. This allows us to find out how our website is being used by our users in general. We do this using identification cookies and similar identifiers. This allows us to find out, for example, which content and topics are particularly popular, when our services are used the most, from which regions (down to the city level) our services are used and which browsers and devices our users generally use.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>We may also carry out so-called A/B tests in the course of usage analysis. A/B tests are a special kind of usage analysis. A/B testing (also known as split testing) is an approach to comparing two versions of a website or app in order to find out which version performs better, is more popular or lets users find their desired content quicker. Producing a version A and version B and testing both versions provides data which makes it easier and faster to make changes to services and content.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Who we share your data with</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>At this time, your personal information is not shared with any other third-party applications.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).
